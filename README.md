Lung disease detection involves using medical imaging (like X-rays or CT scans) to analyze lung structure, identifying abnormalities such as nodules, tumors, or inflammation. Machine learning algorithms aid in pattern recognition to distinguish healthy and diseased lung tissue. These algorithms interpret image features, detecting specific markers or anomalies indicative of conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. Integration of patient data, AI analysis, and expert validation enables accurate diagnosis, aiding in early intervention and treatment planning for improved patient outcomes.
